# 💫 About Me:
Self-taught systems developer based in Munich, Germany.

I design and build D-PlaneOS — a ZFS-first NAS operating system focused on immutability, reproducibility, and operator safety. My homelab (40+ containerised services, 30TB+) serves as a real-world proving ground for infrastructure design decisions.

Day job: IT Support at a systems integrator.
Engineering focus: systems architecture, storage, automation, and operational safety.
